Technical Stack
Frontend: React Native
Backend: Python with Django
AI Integration: OpenAI ChatGPT
Database: PostgreSQL
Version Control: Git
Deployment: Heroku

Technical Aspects
Django Framework: Adopt Django for its robustness, security features, and efficiency in developing complex web applications.
Django Rest Framework: Leverage DRF for creating RESTful APIs to interface with the frontend.
Database Integration: Utilize a relational database like PostgreSQL for its compatibility with Django and support for complex queries and data integrity.
Security: Implement Django’s security features, including its user authentication system, protection against common vulnerabilities, and secure handling of user data.
Scalability: Design with scalability in mind, considering aspects like caching, database optimization, and a scalable deployment solution.

State Management
Context API and Redux will be used for state management in the React Native app, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Development Workflow
Embrace a test-driven development (TDD) approach, utilizing Django’s testing framework.
Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.

Deployment Strategy
Heroku: Our application will be deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that enables simple deployments and management of applications. Heroku’s support for containerization, scalable dynos, and add-ons, such as Heroku Postgres (fully managed SQL database service), makes it an ideal platform for Plumbing Prodigy. Heroku’s GitHub integration will streamline our continuous deployment process, allowing for automated builds and deployments upon code changes. The platform also offers easy scaling options, ensuring that Plumbing Prodigy can efficiently handle varying loads.
