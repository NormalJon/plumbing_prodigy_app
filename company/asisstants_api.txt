https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id}/submit_tool_outputs

When a run has the status: "requires_action" and required_action.type is submit_tool_outputs, this endpoint can be used to submit the outputs from the tool calls once they're all completed. All outputs must be submitted in a single request.

Path parameters
thread_id
string

Required
The ID of the thread to which this run belongs.

run_id
string

Required
The ID of the run that requires the tool output submission.

Request body
tool_outputs
array

Required
A list of tools for which the outputs are being submitted.


Show properties
stream
boolean or null

Optional
If true, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a data: [DONE] message.

Returns
The modified run object matching the specified ID.

StreamingBeta
Stream the result of executing a Run or resuming a Run after submitting tool outputs.

You can stream events from the Create Thread and Run, Create Run, and Submit Tool Outputs endpoints by passing "stream": true. The response will be a Server-Sent events stream.

Our Node and Python SDKs provide helpful utilities to make streaming easy. Reference the Assistants API quickstart to learn more.

id
string

object
string

delta
object

The delta containing the fields that have changed on the Message.

        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
Assistant stream eventsBeta
Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.

Each event in a server-sent events stream has an event and data property:

event: thread.created
data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit thread.run.created when a new run is created, thread.run.completed when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses to create a message during a run, we emit a thread.message.created event, a thread.message.in_progress event, many thread.message.delta events, and finally a thread.message.completed event.

We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully in your code. See the Assistants API quickstart to learn how to integrate the Assistants API with streaming.
