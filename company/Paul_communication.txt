Hi Paul,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm Zach, co-founder of the Plumbing Prodigy app. We're on a mission to revolutionize the plumbing industry by providing professional plumbers with AI-assisted advice and solutions, directly in the field.

Your expertise and background caught our eye, and after a review, Alex (our technical co-founder) and I believe you could be a fantastic fit for a pivotal role in our project. Alex has shared some impressive insights about your potential contribution, and we're both eager to explore this possibility further with you.

We would love to invite you for an interview to discuss your experiences, technical skills, and how you envision contributing to the Plumbing Prodigy app. It will also be a great opportunity for you to learn more about our project, team, and the impact we aim to achieve.

Could you please let us know your availability for a virtual meeting? We're flexible and can adjust to fit your schedule.

Looking forward to potentially working together and hearing your thoughts on how we can make Plumbing Prodigy a success.

Best regards,

Zach
